In such case,\nContractor shall not be entitled to receive any further payment until the Work is finished. If\nthe unpaid balance of the Agreement price exceeds the direct and indirect costs of\ncompleting the project, including compensation for additional professional services, such\n\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\nexcess shall be paid to Contractor.

If the\nparties fail to agree on a settlement amount, Contractor shall be entitled to recover\nexpenses incurred in connection with the performance of the Agreement at its termination\nplus a reasonable profit, provided the amount recoverable plus the cost to complete the\nWork shall in no event exceed the total Agreement price.\n\n17\\.

The parties agree that the existence of, and terms and conditions of, this Agreement and the Scope of Work shall be considered Confidential Information for the purposes of this Section. Confidential Information shall not include information: (i) that was in the public domain, or which subsequently becomes part of the public domain, except by the wrongful disclosure hereunder by the Receiving Party; (ii) that was in the Receiving Party's possession prior to receipt of the same hereunder and was not acquired from a third party under any obligation of confidentiality with respect to such information; (iii) that was received by the Receiving Party from a third party who had a right to make such disclosure; (iv) that can be proven to have been independently developed by the Receiving Party; (v) that is approved in writing for release by the Disclosing Party; or (vi) that a party has been compelled to produce by subpoena or other legal process, provided that such compelled party gives the other party prompt notice of such legal process and cooperates with the other party in seeking a protective order or other appropriate protection. Each party agrees: (i) that the Receiving Party shall treat the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information as confidential and will take reasonable precautions to prevent unauthorized disclosure or use of the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information, such precautions taken being at least as great as the precautions taken to protect its own Confidential Information (but in no case less than reasonable care); (ii) that the Receiving Party will not disclose the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information to any third party without the Disclosing Party's prior written authorization; (iii) that the Receiving Party will not use the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information except for the purpose of providing Work or fulfilling obligations under this Agreement; (iv) that the Receiving Party will promptly return any documents, models, software storage devices, audio tapes, video tapes, or prototypes embodying the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information upon request; and (v) that the Receiving Party will limit disclosure of Confidential Information to those officers and employees of the Receiving Party and any other authorized persons requiring such disclosure to perform Work under this Agreement, in which case the Receiving Party shall notify its employees, officers, and such other authorized persons of their confidentiality obligations with respect to the Confidential Information and shall require such employees, officers and other authorized persons to comply with the obligations in this Section.",
