In such case,\nContractor shall not be entitled to receive any further payment until the Work is finished. If\nthe unpaid balance of the Agreement price exceeds the direct and indirect costs of\ncompleting the project, including compensation for additional professional services, such\n\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\nexcess shall be paid to Contractor.
