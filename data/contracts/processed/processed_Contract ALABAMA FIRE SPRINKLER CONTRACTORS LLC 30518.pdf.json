In such case,\nContractor shall not be entitled to receive any further payment until the Work is finished. If\nthe unpaid balance of the Agreement price exceeds the direct and indirect costs of\ncompleting the project, including compensation for additional professional services, such\n\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\nexcess shall be paid to Contractor.

If the\nparties fail to agree on a settlement amount, Contractor shall be entitled to recover\nexpenses incurred in connection with the performance of the Agreement at its termination\nplus a reasonable profit, provided the amount recoverable plus the cost to complete the\nWork shall in no event exceed the total Agreement price.\n\n17\\.
