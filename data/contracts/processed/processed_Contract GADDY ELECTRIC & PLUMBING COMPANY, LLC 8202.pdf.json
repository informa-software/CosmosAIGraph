In such case, Contractor shall not be entitled to receive any further payment until the Work is finished. If the unpaid balance of the Agreement price exceeds the direct and indirect costs of completing the project, including compensation for additional professional services, such excess shall be paid to Contractor. If such a cost exceeds such unpaid balance, Contractor will pay the difference to Westervelt. Where Contractor's services have been so terminated by Westervelt, said terminations shall not affect any rights of Westervelt against Contractor then existing or which may thereafter accrue. Any retention or payment of moneys by Westervelt due Contractor will not release Contractor from liability. Furthermore, Westervelt may terminate this Agreement at any time without cause and finish the Work in any manner suitable to Westervelt. In such event, Westervelt and Contractor shall attempt to negotiate a mutually satisfactory settlement of the Agreement price. If the parties fail to agree on a settlement amount, Contractor shall be entitled to recover expenses incurred in connection with the performance of the Agreement at its termination plus a reasonable profit, provided the amount recoverable plus the cost to complete the Work shall in no event exceed the total Agreement price.",

If the Agreement price is paid through progress payments, such progress payments shall be based upon Work completed, which shall be evidenced by such documents as Westervelt may reasonably require of Contractor. Under no circumstances shall Westervelt be required to make more than one progress payment per month. Upon notice from Contractor that performance of the Agreement is complete, Westervelt will inspect the Work and will notify Contractor of any deviations, defects, or deficiencies in the Work, <!-- PageBreak --> which such inspection reveals. Westervelt shall not be liable to make a final payment to Contractor until Contractor shall have corrected such deviations, defects, and deficiencies",
