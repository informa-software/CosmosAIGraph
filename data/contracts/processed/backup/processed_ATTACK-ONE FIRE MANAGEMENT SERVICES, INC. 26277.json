Accordingly, in addition to the above provisions and in order to render the parties' intent and this indemnity agreement fully enforceable, Contractor, in a claim hereunder by WES, or any of its officers, agents, directors, employees, contractors, or assigns, hereby waives any and all defenses or immunity Contractor may have under the Workmen's Compensation Laws of any state, or any statute or judicial decision pertaining thereto, and Contractor consents to a cause of action for indemnity hereunder.
