INDEMNITY:\n\nContractor shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Westervelt, and its respective directors, officers,\nagents, employees, contractors, and assigns and each of them (collectively, the \"Indemnitees\") from and\nagainst all actions, liabilities, claims, damages, losses, suits, fines, judgements, and expenses (collectively\n\"Claims\"), including but not limited to, all court costs and attorney's fees, arising out of or in any way\nrelating to or resulting from: (a) the performance of the Work; (b) a violation of federal, state, local,\ninternational or other laws or regulations; (c) bodily injury or death to any person or loss, disappearance\nor damage to tangible or intangible property; (d) Contractor's breach of any term of this Agreement,\nincluding any representation or warranty; (e) any claim of conflict with or infringement upon any patent,\napplication for patent, invention, service mark, trademark, trade name, copyright, trade secret or secret\nformula of any person, corporation, or entity arising out of the Work; or (f) Contractor's negligence or\nwillful misconduct. Such obligation shall not be construed to negate, abridge or otherwise limit any other\nright or obligation of indemnity that otherwise exists in favor of any Indemnitee. In the event and to the\nextent that a claim is made by an employee of Contractor against an Indemnitee, the intent of the Parties\nis that Contractor will indemnify each such Indemnitee to the same extent as if such claim were made by\na nonemployee of Contractor, irrespective of any statute or judicial decision otherwise disallowing such\nindemnity. Accordingly, in addition to the above provisions and in order to render the parties' intent and\nthis indemnity agreement fully enforceable, Contractor, in a claim hereunder by Westervelt, or any of its\nofficers, agents, directors, employees, contractors, or assigns, hereby waives any and all defenses or\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"5\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Docusign Envelope ID: 57EB2528-C243-4421-B6D0-E9BCE6D877F4\" -->\n\nimmunity Contractor may have under the Workmen's Compensation Laws of any state, or any statute or\njudicial decision pertaining thereto, and Contractor consents to a cause of action for indemnity hereunder.\nFurther, under no circumstances shall Westervelt be liable to Contractor for consequential, incidental,\nspecial, or indirect damages arising out of or connected to the performance or non-performance under this\nAgreement. The Indemnitee shall promptly notify Contractor in writing of any action, or a notice of the\ncommencement, or filing of any action (\"Action\") and cooperate with Contractor at Contractor's sole\ncost and expense. Contractor shall promptly take control of the defense and investigation of such Action\nand shall employ counsel of its choice to handle and defend the same, at its sole cost and expense.\nContractor shall not settle any Action in a manner that adversely affects the rights of the Indemnitee\nwithout the Indemnitee's prior written consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. The\nIndemnitee may employ its own counsel to represent it or otherwise participate in and observe the\nproceedings at its own cost and expense. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnitee may defend or\nrespond to any Action, at Contractor's expense, if the Indemnitee's counsel reasonably determines that (i)\nit is necessary to preclude a default judgment from being entered against the Indemnitee, (ii) there are one\nor more defenses available to the Indemnitee that are different from or in addition to those available to\nContractor and the Contractor's counsel could not adequately represent the interest of the Indemnitee\nbecause such interest could be in conflict with those of the Contractor or (iii) such Action involves, or\ncould have a material effect on, any material matter beyond the scope of the indemnification or defense\nobligations of the Contractor. The Indemnitee's failure to perform any obligations under this Section\nshall not relieve the Contractor of its obligations hereunder except to the extent that the Contractor can\ndemonstrate that it has been materially prejudiced as a result of such failure. This Section shall survive\ntermination of the Agreement.\n\n\n## F. SHIPPER COVENANTS AND AGREES:\n\nAs full compensation for the Transportation Services provided by Carrier pursuant to the terms and\nconditions of this Contract, Shipper agrees to pay Carrier in an amount equal to the rates and\naccessorial charges agreed to on Shipper's load confirmation sheet and/or truck booking slip (and any\namendments, supplements and revisions thereto), which are hereby incorporated and made a part of\nthis Contract. Carrier must submit proof of delivery with invoices to Shipper. Payment terms shall\nbe thirty (30) days after receipt by Shipper.\n\n\n## G.

If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or\nunenforceable, the remainder of the Agreement shall continue in full force and effect and shall in no way\nbe impaired or invalidated, and the parties agree to substitute for the invalid or unenforceable provision a\nvalid and enforceable provision that most closely approximates the intent and economic effect of the\ninvalid or unenforceable provision.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"6\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Docusign Envelope ID: 57EB2528-C243-4421-B6D0-E9BCE6D877F4\" -->\n\n4\\.

Each Party agrees that a final judgment in any such\naction, litigation or proceeding is conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the\njudgment or in any other manner provided by law.\n\n5\\. The waiver by one party of the performance of any covenant, condition or promise, or of the time for\nperforming any act, under this Agreement shall not invalidate this Agreement nor shall it be considered a\nwaiver by such party of any other covenant, condition or promise, or of the time for performing any other\nact required, under this Agreement. The exercise of any remedy provided in this Agreement shall not be a\nwaiver of any consistent remedy provided by law, and the provisions of this Agreement for any remedy\nshall not exclude any other consistent remedies unless they are expressly excluded.\n\n6\\. This Agreement shall not be assignable by either party without the prior written consent of the other.\n\n7\\.

Accordingly, in addition to the above provisions and in order to render the parties' intent and this indemnity agreement fully enforceable, Contractor, in a claim hereunder by Westervelt, or any of its officers, agents, directors, employees, contractors, or assigns, hereby waives any and all defenses or immunity Contractor may have under the Workmen's Compensation Laws of any state, or any statute or judicial decision pertaining thereto, and Contractor consents to a cause of action for indemnity hereunder. Further, under no circumstances shall Westervelt be liable to Contractor for consequential, incidental, special, or indirect damages arising out of or connected to the performance or non-performance under this Agreement. The Indemnitee shall promptly notify Contractor in writing of any action, or a notice of the commencement, or filing of any action (\"Action\") and cooperate with Contractor at Contractor's sole cost and expense. Contractor shall promptly take control of the defense and investigation of such Action and shall employ counsel of its choice to handle and defend the same, at its sole cost and expense. Contractor shall not settle any Action in a manner that adversely affects the rights of the Indemnitee without the Indemnitee's prior written consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. The Indemnitee may employ its own counsel to represent it or otherwise participate in and observe the proceedings at its own cost and expense. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnitee may defend or respond to any Action, at Contractor's expense, if the Indemnitee's counsel reasonably determines that (i) it is necessary to preclude a default judgment from being entered against the Indemnitee, (ii) there are one or more defenses available to the Indemnitee that are different from or in addition to those available to Contractor and the Contractor's counsel could not adequately represent the interest of the Indemnitee because such interest could be in conflict with those of the Contractor or (iii) such Action involves, or could have a material effect on, any material matter beyond the scope of the indemnification or defense obligations of the Contractor. The Indemnitee's failure to perform any obligations under this Section shall not relieve the Contractor of its obligations hereunder except to the extent that the Contractor can demonstrate that it has been materially prejudiced as a result of such failure. This Section shall survive termination of the Agreement.",
