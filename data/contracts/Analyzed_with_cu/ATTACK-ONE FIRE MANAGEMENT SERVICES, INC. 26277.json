Such obligation shall not be construed to negate, abridge or otherwise limit any other right or obligation of indemnity that otherwise exists in favor of any Indemnitee. In the event and to the extent that a claim is made by an employee of Contractor against an Indemnitee, the intent of the parties is that Contractor will indemnify each such Indemnitee to the same extent as if such claim were made by a nonemployee of Contractor, irrespective of any statute or judicial decision otherwise disallowing such indemnity. Accordingly, in addition to the above provisions and in order to render the parties' intent and this indemnity agreement fully enforceable, Contractor, in a claim hereunder by WES, or any of its officers, agents, directors, employees, contractors, or assigns, hereby waives any and all defenses or immunity Contractor may have under the Workmen's Compensation Laws of any state, or any statute or judicial decision pertaining thereto, and Contractor consents to a cause of action for indemnity hereunder. Further, under no circumstances shall WES be liable to Contractor for consequential, incidental, special, or indirect damages arising out of or connected to the performance or non-performance under this Agreement.",
