In such case, Contractor shall not be entitled to receive any further payment until the Work is finished. If the unpaid balance of the Agreement price exceeds the direct and indirect costs of completing the project, including compensation for additional professional services, such excess shall be paid to Contractor.

Furthermore, Westervelt may terminate this Agreement at any time without cause and finish the Work in any manner suitable to Westervelt. In such event, Westervelt and Contractor shall attempt to negotiate a mutually satisfactory settlement of the Agreement price. If the parties fail to agree on a settlement amount, Contractor shall be entitled to recover expenses incurred in connection with the performance of the Agreement at its termination plus a reasonable profit, provided the amount recoverable plus the cost to complete the Work shall in no event exceed the total Agreement price.",
