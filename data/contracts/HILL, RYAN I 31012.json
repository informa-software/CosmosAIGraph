Hill\n\nField time - Since this is for data for a 5-year review I plan to be very thorough, and am\nplanning 4 days to account for variable emergence times of adults and to have a chance to\nsee both females and males. Tentative dates are between 15 May and 15 June but may be\nadjusted given field conditions. Field time will be between 4-6 hours each day to assess\nwhat parts of the property butterflies are using, and to do a transect route starting near the\nparking area, travelling uphill of the low drainages in the north-northeast of the property to\nexamine potential nectaring on California Buckeye, thistles, blackberry, or other plants,\nthen up the ridgeline by the Viola preservation and enhancement areas where coyote mint\nmay be present and the butterfly likely exhibits hilltopping behavior, and returning via\npreservation area 1 and checking the lower drainages draining to the east. The method will\nbe a modified Pollard walk that minimizes backtracking, maintains a fairly constant pace\n(except when observing behavior more closely), and provides observations per hour. GPS\ncoordinates will be made for all sightings, and butterflies will be identified using close\nfocus binoculars. The route can be adjusted as necessary to be more comparative to past\nsurveys and methods can be adjusted to more closely follow any methods developed in\ncoordination with the Service. Billing rate is for 5 hours per day of field work at $150/hour.\nField work will be done on appropriate days (clear skies, lower wind if possible) likely\nbetween 9am and 5pm.\n\nField Subtotal - 4 days, 5 hours per day, $150/hour = $3000.00\n\nReport document preparation - A report of findings, including locations mapped, nectar\nuse observations, hostplant observations, phenotypes and pictures of butterflies if\npossible, photos of habitat and nectar plants, Service data sheets, and transect counts,\nwill be provided by September 1st, 2024.\n\nReport Subtotal - 2 days, 6 hours per day, $150/hour = $1800.00\n\nExpenses - mileage from Stockton, CA to Ferrari Ranch (2024 federal rate).\n$0.67 / mile x 118.2 miles (roundtrip) x 4 trips =\nExpenses Subtotal = $316.78\n\nTotal = $5116.78\n\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Ferrari Ranch Preserve Callippe Surveys Ryan Hill\" -->\n\n\n# Exhibit B Minimum Insurance Requirements\n\nConsultant shall maintain the following minimum insurance requirements identified in the Agreement with\nWES.\n\nA.

Tentative dates are between 15 May and 15 June but may be adjusted given field conditions. Field time will be between 4-6 hours each day to assess what parts of the property butterflies are using, and to do a transect route starting near the parking area, travelling uphill of the low drainages in the north-northeast of the property to examine potential nectaring on California Buckeye, thistles, blackberry, or other plants, then up the ridgeline by the Viola preservation and enhancement areas where coyote mint may be present and the butterfly likely exhibits hilltopping behavior, and returning via preservation area 1 and checking the lower drainages draining to the east. The method will be a modified Pollard walk that minimizes backtracking, maintains a fairly constant pace (except when observing behavior more closely), and provides observations per hour. GPS coordinates will be made for all sightings, and butterflies will be identified using close focus binoculars. The route can be adjusted as necessary to be more comparative to past surveys and methods can be adjusted to more closely follow any methods developed in coordination with the Service. Billing rate is for 5 hours per day of field work at $150/hour. Field work will be done on appropriate days (clear skies, lower wind if possible) likely between 9am and 5pm.",
