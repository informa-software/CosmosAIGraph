In the event and to the extent that a claim is made by an employee of\nContractor against an Indemnitee, the intent of the Parties is that Contractor will indemnify\neach such Indemnitee to the same extent as if such claim were made by a nonemployee of\nContractor, irrespective of any statute or judicial decision otherwise disallowing such\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"6\" -->\n<!-- PageFooter=\"17728063.2\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\nindemnity.

Contractor\nshall not settle any Action in a manner that adversely affects the rights of the Indemnitee\nwithout the Indemnitee's prior written consent, such consent not to be unreasonably\nwithheld. The Indemnitee may employ its own counsel to represent it or otherwise\nparticipate in and observe the proceedings at its own cost and expense. Notwithstanding\nthe foregoing, the Indemnitee may defend or respond to any Action, at Contractor's\nexpense, if the Indemnitee's counsel reasonably determines that (i) it is necessary to\npreclude a default judgment from being entered against the Indemnitee, (ii) there are one\nor more defenses available to the Indemnitee that are different from or in addition to those\navailable to Contractor and the Contractor's counsel could not adequately represent the\ninterest of the Indemnitee because such interest could be in conflict with those of the\nContractor or (iii) such Action involves, or could have a material effect on, any material\nmatter beyond the scope of the indemnification or defense obligations of the Contractor.\nThe Indemnitee's failure to perform any obligations under this Section shall not relieve the\nContractor of its obligations hereunder except to the extent that the Contractor can\ndemonstrate that it has been materially prejudiced as a result of such failure.

						"valueString": "Contractor shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless WES, and its respective directors, officers, agents, employees, contractors, and assigns and each of them (collectively, the \"Indemnitees\") from and against all actions, liabilities, claims, damages, losses, suits, fines, judgements, and expenses (collectively \"Claims\"), including but not limited to, all court costs and attorney's fees, arising out of or in any way relating to or resulting from: (a) the performance of the Services; (b) a violation of federal, state, local, international or other laws or regulations; (c) bodily injury or death to any person or loss, disappearance or damage to tangible or intangible property; (d) Contractor's breach of any term of this Agreement, including any representation or warranty; or (e) Contractor's negligence or willful misconduct. Such obligation shall not be construed to negate, abridge or otherwise limit any other right or obligation of indemnity that otherwise exists in favor of any Indemnitee. In the event and to the extent that a claim is made by an employee of Contractor against an Indemnitee, the intent of the Parties is that Contractor will indemnify each such Indemnitee to the same extent as if such claim were made by a nonemployee of Contractor, irrespective of any statute or judicial decision otherwise disallowing such indemnity. Accordingly, in addition to the above provisions and in order to render the Parties' intent and this indemnity agreement fully enforceable, Contractor, in a claim hereunder by WES, or any of its officers, agents, directors, employees, contractors, or assigns, hereby waives any and all defenses or immunity Contractor may have under the Workmen's Compensation Laws of any state, or any statute or judicial decision pertaining thereto, and Contractor consents to a cause of action for indemnity hereunder. Further, under no circumstances shall WES be liable to Contractor for consequential, incidental, special, or indirect damages arising out of or connected to the performance or non- performance under this Agreement. The Indemnitee shall promptly notify Contractor in writing of any action, or a notice of the commencement, or filing of any action (\"Action\") and cooperate with Contractor at Contractor's sole cost and expense. Contractor shall promptly take control of the defense and investigation of such Action and shall employ counsel of its choice to handle and defend the same, at its sole cost and expense. Contractor shall not settle any Action in a manner that adversely affects the rights of the Indemnitee without the Indemnitee's prior written consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. The Indemnitee may employ its own counsel to represent it or otherwise participate in and observe the proceedings at its own cost and expense. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnitee may defend or respond to any Action, at Contractor's expense, if the Indemnitee's counsel reasonably determines that (i) it is necessary to preclude a default judgment from being entered against the Indemnitee, (ii) there are one or more defenses available to the Indemnitee that are different from or in addition to those available to Contractor and the Contractor's counsel could not adequately represent the interest of the Indemnitee because such interest could be in conflict with those of the Contractor or (iii) such Action involves, or could have a material effect on, any material matter beyond the scope of the indemnification or defense obligations of the Contractor. The Indemnitee's failure to perform any obligations under this Section shall not relieve the Contractor of its obligations hereunder except to the extent that the Contractor can demonstrate that it has been materially prejudiced as a result of such failure. This Section shall survive termination of the Agreement.",

Invoices shall be consolidated as one lump sum not to exceed $172,523.00. Contractor further agrees to provide, with each invoice, all such information as WES may require evidencing Contractor's right to the payment claimed and the Services performed. Contractor warrants that upon submittal of an invoice, all Services for which Contractor has been previously paid shall be free and clear of liens, claims, security interests or encumbrances in favor of Contractor, subcontractors, material suppliers, or other persons or entities making a claim by reason of having provided labor, materials and equipment relating to the Services. Invoices will be submitted by Contractor following clearly defined completion of tasks. Contractor is solely responsible for all of its costs and expenses incurred in performing the Services and WES will not be billed for, nor be obligated to pay to Contractor any charges, expenses, or other amounts for the Services or otherwise. Contractor will be solely responsible for all due diligence necessary for its proper performance of the Services. Failure to carry out such due diligence will not be a basis upon which to increase the fees or charges or to refuse to provide or modify any of the Services after the execution of the Agreement. The making of any payment by WES, or the receipt thereof by Contractor, will in no way affect the responsibility of Contractor to perform the Services in accordance with this Agreement, and will not imply WES's acceptance of any Services or the waiver of any warranties or requirements of this Agreement.",
