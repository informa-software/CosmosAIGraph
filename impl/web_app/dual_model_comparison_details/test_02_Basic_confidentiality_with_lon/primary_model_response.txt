RISK ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overall Risk: high
Risk Score: 0.90

Identified Risks:

1. LIABILITY - high
   Description: Absence of indemnification exposes parties to unmitigated liability for breaches, negligence, IP infringement, and legal violations.
   Impact: If a party suffers losses due to the other party's actions, there is no contractual mechanism for compensation or defense.
   Location: entire clause

2. DISPUTE RESOLUTION - medium
   Description: No process for notification or cooperation in defense of claims, increasing risk of unmanaged legal disputes.
   Impact: Parties may be unable to coordinate defense or mitigate damages, leading to higher costs and exposure.
   Location: entire clause

3. SCOPE LIMITATION - medium
   Description: Confidentiality clause does not address indemnification, leaving other risks unaddressed.
   Impact: Contract only protects confidential information, not broader contractual risks.
   Location: entire clause

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RECOMMENDATIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. ADDITION - Priority: high
   Add a mutual indemnification clause to address liability for breaches, negligence, IP infringement, and legal violations.
   Suggested Text:
   Each party (the "Indemnifying Party") shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the other party (the "Indemnified Party"), its affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents from and against any and all claims, demands, losses, liabilities, damages, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and court costs) arising out of or relating to: Any breach of this Agreement by the Indemnifying Party; Any negligent acts or omissions or willful misconduct by the Indemnifying Party; Any infringement or alleged infringement of any intellectual property rights by the Indemnifying Party; Any violation of applicable laws or regulations by the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnified Party shall provide the Indemnifying Party with prompt written notice of any claim and shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in the defense of such claim.
   Rationale: This addition is critical to mitigate legal risks and ensure both parties are protected from losses arising from the other's actions.

2. MODIFICATION - Priority: medium
   Clarify that confidentiality obligations are separate from indemnification obligations.
   Suggested Text:
   The receiving party will keep confidential information secret and not disclose it to third parties. This obligation lasts for 5 years after termination. These confidentiality obligations are in addition to, and do not limit, the parties' indemnification obligations under this Agreement.
   Rationale: Ensures that confidentiality and indemnification are treated as distinct protections, reducing ambiguity.
