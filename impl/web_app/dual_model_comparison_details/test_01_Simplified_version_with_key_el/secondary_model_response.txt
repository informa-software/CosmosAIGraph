RISK ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overall Risk: high
Risk Score: 0.80

Identified Risks:

1. SCOPE LIMITATION - high
   Description: Contract clause limits indemnification to 'claims' only, omitting broader protections such as demands, losses, liabilities, damages, costs, and expenses including attorneys' fees.
   Impact: Potential under-protection of the indemnified party leading to uncovered costs and liabilities.
   Location: indemnification scope

2. LIMITED INDEMNIFICATION TRIGGERS - high

   Impact: Exposes indemnified party to risks from serious breaches or legal violations without indemnity protection.
   Location: indemnification triggers

3. MISSING COOPERATION OBLIGATION - medium

   Impact: May hinder the indemnifying party's ability to properly defend claims, increasing costs or liabilities.
   Location: cooperation obligation

4. NOTICE REQUIREMENT VAGUENESS - medium
   Description: Contract's notice requirement is less detailed and does not specify written notice or timing beyond 'promptly'.
   Impact: Could lead to disputes over timeliness or adequacy of notice, affecting indemnification rights.
   Location: notice requirement

   Description: Contract does not explicitly include affiliates, officers, directors, employees, and agents as indemnified parties.
   Impact: Potentially excludes important related parties from indemnity protection.
   Location: indemnified parties

RECOMMENDATIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. MODIFICATION - Priority: high
   Expand indemnification scope to include all claims, demands, losses, liabilities, damages, costs, and expenses including reasonable attorneys' fees and court costs.
   Suggested Text:
   Each party (the "Indemnifying Party") shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the other party (the "Indemnified Party"), its affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents from and against any and all claims, demands, losses, liabilities, damages, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and court costs) arising out of or relating to: Any breach of this Agreement by the Indemnifying Party; Any negligent acts or omissions or willful misconduct by the Indemnifying Party; Any infringement or alleged infringement of any intellectual property rights by the Indemnifying Party; Any violation of applicable laws or regulations by the Indemnifying Party.
   Rationale: To ensure comprehensive protection consistent with standard mutual indemnification provisions and reduce exposure to uncovered liabilities.

2. ADDITION - Priority: medium
   Add explicit cooperation obligation for the indemnified party to assist in defense of claims.
   Suggested Text:
   The Indemnified Party shall provide the Indemnifying Party with prompt written notice of any claim and shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in the defense of such claim.
   Rationale: To facilitate effective defense and reduce risk of increased costs or liabilities due to lack of cooperation.

3. MODIFICATION - Priority: medium
   Clarify notice requirement to specify 'prompt written notice' rather than just 'notice must be provided promptly'.
   Suggested Text:
   The Indemnified Party shall provide the Indemnifying Party with prompt written notice of any claim.
   Rationale: To reduce ambiguity and potential disputes regarding the timing and form of notice.
