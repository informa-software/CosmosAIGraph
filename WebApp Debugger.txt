 For debugging the Python Web App, you have several excellent options. The code is already set up for debugging
  with debugpy. Here's how to connect a debugger:

  Option 1: VS Code (Recommended)

  Setup VS Code Debugging

  1. Open the project in VS Code:
  cd C:\Users\user\source\Informa\ContractAnalysis\CosmosAIGraph\impl
  code .

  2. Create a launch configuration:
  Create or update .vscode/launch.json:

● Write(.vscode\launch.json)
  ⎿  Wrote 1 lines to .vscode\launch.json
     {
         "version": "0.2.0",
         "configurations": [
             {
                 "name": "Python: FastAPI Web App",
                 "type": "python",
                 "request": "launch",
                 "module": "uvicorn",
                 "args": [
                     "web_app:app",

● Method A: Launch with Debugger

  1. Open VS Code
  2. Go to Run and Debug (Ctrl+Shift+D)
  3. Select "Python: FastAPI Web App" from dropdown
  4. Press F5 to start with debugger attached
  5. Set breakpoints by clicking left of line numbers

  Method B: Attach to Running Process

  The web app is already configured with debugpy! Look at line 55-56 in web_app.py:

  import debugpy

  To enable remote debugging, modify the web_app.py:

● Read(web_app\web_app.py)
  ⎿  Read 30 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Great! The app already has debugpy configured. Here's how to use it:

  Enable Debug Mode:

  1. Set environment variable (before starting the app):
  # In PowerShell
  $env:CAIG_WAIT_FOR_DEBUGGER = "true"

  # Or add to your .env file
  echo "CAIG_WAIT_FOR_DEBUGGER=true" >> web_app\.env

  2. Start the web app:
  cd web_app
  python web_app.py
  # It will print: "Waiting for debugger attach..."

  3. In VS Code:
    - Go to Run and Debug (Ctrl+Shift+D)
    - Select "Python: Attach to Running Web App"
    - Press F5
    - The app will continue running once attached

  Option 2: PyCharm Professional

  1. Create a Run Configuration:
    - Run → Edit Configurations
    - Add New → Python
    - Script path: C:\...\web_app\web_app.py
    - Working directory: C:\...\web_app
    - Environment variables: Add from .env file
  2. Debug:
    - Set breakpoints
    - Click Debug button (Shift+F9)

  Option 3: Visual Studio 2022

  1. Open the project:
    - File → Open → Folder
    - Select the web_app folder
  2. Configure Python environment:
    - View → Other Windows → Python Environments
    - Select your virtual environment
  3. Debug:
    - Debug → Start Debugging (F5)
    - Or attach to process

  Option 4: Command Line with pdb

  For quick debugging without IDE:

● Write(web_app\debug_helper.py)
  ⎿  Wrote 1 lines to web_app\debug_helper.py
     """
     Debug helper for quick debugging without IDE
     Add breakpoints in your code with:
         from debug_helper import bp
         bp()  # Breakpoint here
     """
     import pdb
     import sys

● Quick Debugging Setup Script

● Write(web_app\start_debug.ps1)
  ⎿  Wrote 1 lines to web_app\start_debug.ps1
     # PowerShell script to start web app in debug mode
     Write-Host "Starting Web App in Debug Mode..." -ForegroundColor Cyan
     Write-Host "The app will wait for debugger attachment on port 5678" -ForegroundColor Yellow
     # Set debug environment variable
     $env:CAIG_WAIT_FOR_DEBUGGER = "true"
     Write-Host "`nTo attach debugger:" -ForegroundColor Green
     Write-Host "1. Open VS Code" -ForegroundColor White
     Write-Host "2. Go to Run and Debug (Ctrl+Shift+D)" -ForegroundColor White

● Common Debugging Scenarios

  1. Debug a specific endpoint:

  @app.post("/ai_completion")
  async def post_ai_completion(req_model: AiCompletionRequestModel):
      import pdb; pdb.set_trace()  # Add breakpoint
      # Your code here

  2. Debug async functions:

  async def get_rag_data(self, user_text):
      # For async debugging in VS Code
      await asyncio.sleep(0)  # Allow debugger to catch up
      breakpoint()  # Python 3.7+ built-in

  3. Debug with logging:

  import logging
  logging.warning(f"DEBUG: Variable value = {variable}")

  Recommended Tools Summary

  | Tool        | Best For                                  | Setup Difficulty |
  |-------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------|
  | VS Code     | Full-featured debugging, best integration | Easy             |
  | PyCharm Pro | Advanced debugging features               | Easy             |
  | debugpy     | Remote debugging, production debugging    | Medium           |
  | pdb         | Quick command-line debugging              | Easy             |

  Quick Start

  The fastest way to start debugging:

  # Terminal 1: Start app in debug mode
  cd web_app
  .\start_debug.ps1

  # Terminal 2: Or without waiting
  python web_app.py

  Then in VS Code:
  1. Open the project
  2. Set breakpoints
  3. Press F5 with "Python: Attach to Running Web App" selected

  The debugger will attach and stop at your breakpoints!

  Testing Your Debug Setup

  Add a test breakpoint:

● Write(web_app\test_debug.py)
  ⎿  Wrote 1 lines to web_app\test_debug.py
     """
     Test script to verify debugging is working
     Run this to test your debug setup
     """
     def test_function(x, y):
         result = x + y
         breakpoint()  # Should stop here
         print(f"Result: {result}")
         return result

● Run this test:
  cd web_app
  python test_debug.py

  If the debugger stops at the breakpoint, your setup is working!
