Here are several ways to check if the Graph App is running:

  1. Direct HTTP Health Check

  # Check the ping endpoint
  curl http://localhost:8001/ping

  # Check the detailed health endpoint
  curl http://localhost:8001/health

  # Check if the ontology endpoint responds
  curl http://localhost:8001/ontology

  2. Check Running Java Processes

  # Windows PowerShell
  Get-Process java | Select-Object ProcessName, Id, StartTime, CommandLine

  # Or check for the specific port
  netstat -an | findstr :8001

  # Windows Command Prompt
  tasklist | findstr java

  3. Test SPARQL Query Endpoint

  # Test with a simple SPARQL query to count triples
  curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/sparql_query \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"sparql": "SELECT (COUNT(*) as ?count) WHERE { ?s ?p ?o }"}'

  4. Check Application Logs

  # If running via Gradle
  # Look in the console output or:
  cd graph_app
  cat tmp/*.log

  # Check for the startup message
  # Should see: "Started WebApp in X seconds"

  5. Via the Web App UI

  If the Web App is running, you can:
  1. Navigate to http://localhost:8000
  2. Go to the SPARQL Console page
  3. If it loads without errors, the Graph App is reachable

  6. Docker Status (if using Docker)

  # Check if container is running
  docker ps | grep graph

  # Check container logs
  docker logs cosmosaidb-graph-1

  # Or with docker-compose
  docker-compose ps

  7. PowerShell Script to Check

  # Save as check-graph-app.ps1
  $url = "http://localhost:8001/ping"
  try {
      $response = Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $url -UseBasicParsing -TimeoutSec 5
      if ($response.StatusCode -eq 200) {
          Write-Host "✓ Graph App is running" -ForegroundColor Green
          Write-Host "Response: $($response.Content)"
      }
  } catch {
      Write-Host "✗ Graph App is not responding" -ForegroundColor Red
      Write-Host "Error: $_"
  }

  # Also check the port
  $connection = Test-NetConnection -ComputerName localhost -Port 8001
  if ($connection.TcpTestSucceeded) {
      Write-Host "✓ Port 8001 is open" -ForegroundColor Green
  } else {
      Write-Host "✗ Port 8001 is not accessible" -ForegroundColor Yellow
  }

  8. Start the Graph App if Not Running

  If it's not running, start it with:

  # Navigate to graph_app directory
  cd graph_app

  # Windows
  .\gradlew.bat bootRun
  # or
  .\graph_app.ps1

  # Linux/Mac
  ./gradlew bootRun
  # or
  ./graph_app.sh

  9. Check Configuration

  Verify the app has proper configuration:

  # Check if config file exists
  cd graph_app
  ls .override.properties

  # Verify environment variables are set
  # PowerShell
  $env:CAIG_GRAPH_SOURCE_TYPE
  $env:CAIG_GRAPH_MODE

  10. Expected Startup Log Messages

  When the Graph App starts successfully, you should see messages like:

  INFO  AppConfig - initialize reading infile: .../.override.properties
  WARN  AppGraphBuilder - build() start
  WARN  AppGraphBuilder - populateFromCosmosDbNoSQL, mode: contracts
  INFO  AppGraph - query() executing SPARQL
  WARN  AppGraphBuilder - build() finish
  INFO  WebApp - Started WebApp in X seconds (JVM running for Y)

  Common Issues and Solutions

  If Graph App is not running:

  1. Port already in use:
  # Find what's using port 8001
  netstat -ano | findstr :8001
  2. Missing configuration:
    - Ensure .override.properties exists
    - Check CosmosDB connection settings
  3. Java not installed:
  java -version  # Should be Java 21
  4. Build issues:
  cd graph_app
  .\gradlew.bat clean build

  The most reliable quick check is the ping endpoint - if curl http://localhost:8001/ping returns a response, the
  Graph App is running properly.
