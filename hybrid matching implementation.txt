 Perfect! The hybrid matching implementation is working well. Let's create a summary:

  Summary

  I've successfully implemented a hybrid company name matching solution for both ContractorParty and
  ContractingParty entities in the ContractEntitiesService. The implementation combines multiple matching
  techniques for superior accuracy:

  Key Features Implemented:

  1. Hybrid Matching Algorithm (hybrid_company_match method):
    - Jaro-Winkler distance (70% weight): Best for company names with similar prefixes
    - Token-based similarity (30% weight): Handles reordered words perfectly
    - Phonetic matching bonus (10% bonus): Using Metaphone for spelling variations
    - Domain-specific normalization: Removes 20+ common company suffixes
  2. Enhanced Normalization:
    - Removes common suffixes (LLC, Inc, Corp, Ltd, etc.)
    - Strips leading "The" from company names
    - Handles punctuation and special characters
    - Normalizes spaces to underscores
  3. Improved Entity Identification:
    - Uses hybrid matching for all party entities
    - Provides confidence scores and match methods
    - Separates high-confidence matches (≥0.95) from fuzzy matches
    - Includes detailed match information for debugging

  Test Results:

  - ✅ All 8 unit tests passing
  - ✅ Exact match after normalization: "ABC Corp" = "ABC Corporation" (Score: 1.0)
  - ✅ Reordered words: "First National Bank" ≈ "National First Bank" (Score: 0.85)
  - ✅ Suffix variations: "Alabama Fire Sprinkler Contractors" = "Alabama Fire Sprinkler Contractors LLC" (Score:
  1.0)

  Matching Thresholds:

  - ≥ 0.95: Very high confidence (auto-accept)
  - ≥ 0.85: High confidence (default threshold)
  - ≥ 0.70: Moderate confidence (may need review)
  - < 0.70: Low confidence (likely different entities)

  The solution provides significant improvements over the basic SequenceMatcher approach, particularly for:
  - Company name variations with different legal suffixes
  - Reordered company names
  - Minor typos and spelling differences
  - Consistent normalization of entity names

  This will greatly improve the accuracy of entity identification and matching in your contract analysis system.
